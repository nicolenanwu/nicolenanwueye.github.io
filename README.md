Eye Movement Project
Description: In this project, I build a page where the eyeballs will fall the movement of your mouse

To access the repo: click https://github.com/nicolenanwu/nicolenanwueye.github.io

To access the html click

How to interact:
Just move your mouse around the page, and observe how the eyeballs move with it.

Future development:
I can build other interesting objects like a compass.
Or I can build a random function into the eyeball or compass to randomly rotate the eye as a feature.
